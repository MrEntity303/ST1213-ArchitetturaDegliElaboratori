Group project "DekketScris"

* Simone Cisca, alias, SpaceCowboyS01



Using an Arduino Uno R3 ATMEGA328P as a steganograph.
The project involves writing the software code and building the circuit.

The steganograph will be powered via PowerBank or other power supply via the USB2.0 Type A / B cable.
How to use it:

In an SD card, put input.txt and input.bmp in order to perform the "hiding" function.

Enter only input.bmp to perform the "unveilnig" function.
